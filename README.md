This repository is a collection of CLAS12 collaboration event generators, mostly in the form of git submodules, plus a central build "system".  Builds for these generators are supported on the CLAS12 Open Science Grid portal, locally at JLab, and via CVMFS.

# Adding or Modifying a Generator

1. Create a github repository for your source code, ideally inside https://github.com/JeffersonLab
2. Make sure to include the README.md describing the generator, its options, and requirements
3. Have a working build system (for example a Makefile)
4. Satisfy the additional requirements described below
5. Send email to Mauri (`ungaro at jlab.org`) or Nathan (`baltzell at jlab.org`) with the repository address and the git tag to use

# Requirements

- C/C++/Fortran/python3, with a working GNU make or cmake build system compliant with GCC no less than 9.0
- The top level README file should contain:
  - The location of the executable(s) and any shared libraries produced and required at runtime
  - Required environment variables
  - Documentation on all command-line options
- The executable to be used on OSG should have the same name as the github repository name and be runnable from any current working directory
- The default output LUND filename should be the same as the exectuable + `.dat`. For example, the output of clasdis must be clasdis.dat
- The follow command-line arguments are always passed to all generators on OSG:
  - `--trig #` must be honored and used to specify the number of events to generate.
  - `--docker` must be accepted as a valid argument and can be ignored or used for setting conditions for OSG.
  - `--seed #` must be accepted as a valid argument and can be ignored or used to initialize the event generator's RNG.  Its value is a 32-bit RNG seed based on system clock with microsecond precision.  If `--seed` is ignored, the generator is responsible for choosing unique random seeds, without preserving state between jobs, which can be done from a millisecond or better precision system clock.
- A git tag to reference for including the generator as a submodule into this repository.  Note [versions.json](versions.json) stores the current verisions for insertion into the data stream.
- Note, currently CLAS12's OSG web submission portal does not support configuration files for event generators, so users' runtime options must be supported via command-line options.
  -  Some generators do that via a wrapper script that generates a configuration file on-the-fly.
  -  If there's popular demand for it, support for user-defined configuration files could be added.
